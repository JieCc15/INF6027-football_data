INF6027 Project : This project is dedicated to analyzing football match statistics and their relationship with team success. A comprehensive overview of match data, predictive modeling, and feature importance will be shared on this page.
This is a separate project that deals with similar data analysis methodologies. Make sure to provide a link to this repository once it is available on GitHub.
Code: Include all your scripts, such as data processing, exploratory analysis, and modeling. 
R code files can be found here: Report.Rmd
Instructions on Running the Code: 
Install required R packages: install.packages(c("ggplot2", "randomForest", "caret"))
Load Data: data <- read.csv("matches.csv")
Run the analysis by following the steps outlined in the Report.Rmd file.
Information Provided on GitHub:
Match Data: Uploaded the dataset matches.csv containing variables such as goals, shots, passes, and player statistics for analysis.
Visualizations: Plots generated by ggplot2 for examining distributions, correlations, and comparisons.
Modeling: Code for logistic regression and random forest models to predict match outcomes and assess feature importance.
